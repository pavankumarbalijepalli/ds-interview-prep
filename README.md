# Data Science Interview Prep
When preparing for a data science interview, it's essential to have a solid understanding of key topics and concepts. Here are some important areas to cover:

- __Statistics and Probability:__

  - [ ] Descriptive statistics: mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation.
  - [ ] Probability concepts: conditional probability, Bayes' theorem, random variables, distributions (normal, binomial, Poisson).
  - [ ] Hypothesis testing: null and alternative hypotheses, p-values, confidence intervals.
- __Machine Learning:__

  - [x] Supervised learning: regression (linear regression, logistic regression), classification (decision trees, random forests, support vector machines).
  - [ ] Unsupervised learning: clustering (k-means, hierarchical clustering), dimensionality reduction (principal component analysis, t-SNE).
  - [ ] Evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve, AUC-ROC.
  - [x] Overfitting, underfitting, regularization techniques (L1/L2 regularization).
- __Programming and Data Manipulation:__

  - [x] Proficiency in programming languages such as Python or R.
  - [x] Data manipulation libraries: pandas, NumPy.
  - [x] Data visualization libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn.
  - [x] SQL for data extraction and manipulation.
  - [x] Experience with data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering.
- __Data Exploration and Analysis:__

  - [x] Exploratory data analysis (EDA): summary statistics, data visualization, handling missing values, outliers.
  - [x] Feature selection and extraction techniques.
  - [x] Dealing with imbalanced datasets.
  - [ ] Time series analysis and forecasting.
  - [ ] A/B testing and experimental design.
- __Big Data and Distributed Computing:__

  - [ ] Understanding of distributed computing frameworks: Hadoop, Spark.
  - [ ] Familiarity with cloud platforms: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud.
  - [ ] Handling large datasets and parallel processing.
  - [ ] MapReduce paradigm and its applications.
- __Deep Learning and Neural Networks:__

  - [x] Neural network architecture: feedforward, recurrent, convolutional.
  - [x] Activation functions: sigmoid, tanh, ReLU.
  - [x] Backpropagation and gradient descent.
  - [x] Popular deep learning frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch.
- __Data Science Workflow and Communication:__

  - [x] Project lifecycle and best practices.
  - [x] Experimental design and hypothesis formulation.
  - [x] Documentation and presentation skills.
  - [x] Ability to communicate complex ideas to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Remember to practice coding exercises, work on real-world projects, and review specific concepts and algorithms to reinforce your understanding. Good luck with your interview preparation!
